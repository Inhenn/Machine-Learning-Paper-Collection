# Recommendation System

## Matrix Factorization

1. [Multiverse Recommendation: N-dimensional Tensor Factorization for Context-aware Collaborative Filtering](https://xamat.github.io/pubs/karatzoglu-recsys-2010.pdf)

&nbsp;HOSVD decomposition, high dimension factorization, central tensor 

2. [Relational Learning via Collective Matrix Factorization](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/singh-gordon-kdd-factorization.pdf)

&nbsp;Assign 0 of the learning rate for unobserved entries
        
&nbsp;Generialize to n-d matrix
        
&nbsp;Same latent matrix for the same entity for different relationship
        
        
3. [Item Cold-Start Recommendations: Learning Local Collective Embeddings](http://web.media.mit.edu/~msaveski/assets/publications/2014_item_cold_start/paper.pdf)
        
&nbsp;Common latent space with locality added
        
&nbsp;Easy to follow optimization process
