# Machine-Learning-Paper-Collection
A Collection of Machine Learning Papers I Found Interesting

This is a git repo for the ML/DL/RL paper I recently read. I also put some personal comments as reading notes below each paper. The first focus of this repo will be recommendation system and it will potentially be extented to other topics such as NLP or RL
